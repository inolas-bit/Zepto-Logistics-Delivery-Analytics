## 📊 Power BI Dashboard (Zepto-Themed)

- 📈 KPIs: Cost per Order, Avg Delivery Time, Delay %
- 🧭 Drill-through: Vendor View, Zone-wise Metrics
- 📍 Geo Filters: Partner Zone, Hour of Day, Day of Week
- 🎨 Custom Theme: Built using Zepto’s color palette

> Final Power BI `.pbix` file and theme `.json` available in the `/dashboard/` folder.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- ⚠️ 80% of order delays traced to 3 vendors in peak evening hours
- 🚛 Route Cluster Z showed 22% higher delivery cost due to inefficient mapping
- 📦 Inventory demand spikes on Fridays by ~22%
- 💸 ₹12+ per order can be saved through optimized partner allocation
